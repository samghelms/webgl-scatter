# intro

This is a really simple interactive scatter plot for viewing tsne embeddings. I built it to experiment with Uber's deck.gl library.

Note: the plot is zoomed pretty far out at the start, so it's pretty hard to hover over exact points. Zoom in using your mouse wheel or by double clicking and the points should increase in size.
